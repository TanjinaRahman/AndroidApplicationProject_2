# MyWay
(An android application project)

## Introduction
This apps will work as a medium to connect the customers with the workers to buy or send a parcel. There are many companies to deliver parcel and there are also many online shopping agencies. But it takes time to deliver product. Sometimes one or two days. In that case we are really unable to buy perishable products. Sometimes we want our product as early as possible. This is why we need this apps. Here the workers are nothing but travellers who wants to carry product and deliver to the customer on their way. So, it will take much less time as well as both worker and customer will be benefited.

## Tools
- Android Studio 3.2.1
- Firebase (Database)
- Java (Language)

  ## Future Work
  I've many plans on this project. I want to improve rating system and to add payment method. I also want to connect sellers with this apps and their payment method. So, a lot of works to do here.
  
  ## Conclusion
  I hope this apps will be user friendly. As users can get their service here in the earliest time of any other systems, they must love this apps. On the other hand, worker can make some money in their travelling time. Sellers will be benifited also as their rate of sale will be increased. So, we can hope that this apps will make our life easier and everyone connected with this apps is going to love this product.
