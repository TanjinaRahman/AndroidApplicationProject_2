##### An android application project 

## Introduction
This apps will work as a medium to connect the customers with the workers to buy or send a parcel. There are many companies to deliver parcel and there are also many online shopping agencies. But it takes time to deliver product. Sometimes one or two days. In that case we are really unable to buy perishable products. Sometimes we want our product as early as possible. This is why we need this apps. Here the workers are nothing but travellers who wants to carry product and deliver to the customer on their way. So, it will take much less time as well as both worker and customer will be benefited.
